w3notice by Thomas Stromberg

***********
What is it?
***********

Get notified with a list of changes when a webpage is modified and
matches your keyword. Useful if you are monitoring a class news site for
schedule changes or checking to see when your favorite employer posts a job
for UNIX positions!




************
Requirements
************

Any UNIX system with crontab access and GNU diff.
Lynx if you want to have the HTML formatted into plain text or POST.




*****
Usage
*****

Get notified at the 10th minute of every hour if any news gets posted for my
math class, so long as the page has the letter "a" somewhere in the text:
10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/w3notice "http://www.math.ncsu.edu/ma107/news.html" 'a'



Check if Indiana University posts any jobs we may like, once a day:
1 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/w3notice "https://wwwdb.ucs.indiana.edu/humanresources/secure/app/techjobreq.cfm" 'unix|macos|mac os|linux|solaris|sgi|irix'



To have it e-mail you when Nikon Service updates your repair ticket. This
example is more complex because it requires you to POST your input. To do
so, you add the variables to the end of the URL with a | in between. Lynx is
required.

Then you can add a crontab to runs at 10am and 4pm:

0 10,16 * * * /usr/local/bin/w3notice "https://www.nikonimagesvcapprove.com/status/check.cfm|billname1=strom&orderno=4092490"
